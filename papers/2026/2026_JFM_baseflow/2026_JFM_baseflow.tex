\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
Investigations of the near-wake generated by a high-speed slender body have been studied over decades due to its importance to the areodynamic design. Most of the research focus on the 




\section{Problem formulation}
\subsection{Flow set-up}
A sketch of the flow set-up is shown in figure~\ref{fig: sketch_setup}. A slender cylinder of radius $R$ has its axisymmetric axis aligned with the x-direction and the origin is located at the center of the cylinder base. Distances upstream and downstream of the base plane are $10R$ and $16R$, respectively. Such a choice guranttees a long enough distance for turbulence to develop along the cylinder, and the outflow boundary are far engough to affect the near-wake region. The far-field boundary is $10R$ from the axisymmetric axis. In total five cases are performed, with various Mach numbers and Reynolds numbers. The details of flow conditions are given in table~\ref{tab: flow_condition}.  jfkd 
Riemann-invariant conditions are applied the far-field boundary. At the right boundary, the supersonic outflow condition is applied. All cases posses an isothermal no-slip wall conditions, with the wall temperature varied to keep a constant wall-to-recovery temperature ratio. For the inflow, a synthetic eddy method (SEM) is used to facilitate the development a turbulent boundary layer before it reaches the base corner. For a typical SEM, vortices of different length scales are generated in a virtual inlet domain, whose induced field are added to a prescribed mean flow profile to mimic the behaviour of a true turbluent boudnary layer. A detailed review can be found in XXX and. In the current work, the inflow generation method is built upon the methodology proposed by~\cite{pamies2009generation}. Such method generate different shapes of vorticies based on the wall distance, and requires the viscous length and velocity scale \textit{a priori}. In a high Mach nubmer compressible boundary layer, these scales often have strong variations with wall distance and are difficult to obtain with simple calculations. Here we generate mean flow profiles of velocity and temperature based on the method of ~\cite{manzoor2024estimating}, which can then be used for the calculation of viscous length and velocity scales. With the above information, eddies of generatign. A more detailed discription can be found in Appendix XXX. In the current work, we limit the prescribed inlet $Re_\delta_2$ at $350$ and a wall-to-recovery temperature ratio to 0.2.

\subsection{Governing equations}
The simulations are performed by solving the compressible Navier-Stokes equation, given as 
\begin{equation}
\dfrac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \dfrac{\partial \rho u_j }{\partial x_j} = 0
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{\partial \rho u_i}{\partial t} + \dfrac{\partial \rho u_i u_j }{\partial x_j} = -\dfrac{\partial p}{\partial x_i} +\dfrac{\partial \tau_{ij}}{\partial x_j} + \rho f_i
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\dfrac{\partial \rho E}{\partial t} + \dfrac{\partial \rho u_j E }{\partial x_j} = -\dfrac{\partial p u_j}{\partial x_j} + \dfrac{\partial (u_k\tau_{kj}-q_j)}{\partial x_j} + \rho f_j u_j
\end{equation}
Here $\tau_{ij}$ is the stress tensor given as 
\begin{equation}
\tau_{ij} = (\mu+\mu_\text{sgs})\left( \dfrac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j}+ \dfrac{\partial u_j}{\partial x_i}-\dfrac{2}{3}\delta_{ij}\dfrac{u_k}{x_k}\right)
\end{equation}
with subscript '$\text{sgs}$' being the component contributed by sub-grid scale (SGS) model. The heat flux vector $q_j$ is defined as 
\begin{equation}
q_j = -C_p(\dfrac{\mu}{Pr}+ \dfrac{\mu_\text{sgs}}{Pr_\text{sgs}} )\dfrac{\partial T}{\partial x_j}
\end{equation}
where $C_p$ is the heat capacity at constant pressure, $\gamma = 1.4$ is the ratio of specific heat and $Pr = 0.72$ is the Prandtl number. At such high Mach number, there is a chance for the real-gas effectd to emerge, which is, however, beyong the scope of the current work. The fluid is assumed to be air and follow the ideal gas law, i.e., $p = \rho R_\text{gas} T$ . The gas constant $R_\text{gas}$ takes the value of $286.9 J/(kg\cdot K)$. The dynamic viscosity is assumed to follow Sutherland's law~\ref{sutherland1893lii}, which is 
\begin{equation}
  \mu = \dfrac{C_1 T^{3/2}}{T+S}
\end{equation}
where $S = 110.4 K$, $C_1 = 1.458 \times 10^{-6} kg/(m\cdot s \cdot \sqrt{K}$). Unless otherwise stated, the cylinder radius and free stream parameters are used for non-dimensionalization, i.e., $R$, $\rho_\infty$, $u_\infty$, $T_\infty$. 



\subsection{Numerical Setup}
\Yongkai{1. We need to be careful about the code description here. 2. I prefer to rename the code (not COOLES), maybe Hyves.  }  
The simulations are performed by a C++ code XXX, under development at the Data-Fluid Lab at Beijing Institute of Technology. The code is based on the flux reconstruction (FR)~\citep{huynh2007flux} method to provide a high-order, high flexibility solution for flow over complex geometries, and is designed for a hybrid CPU-GPU computational framework. The FR scheme approximates the solution with polynomials in each cell, and requires the evaluation of fluxes at the cell interface. In the current solver, a Rusanov Riemann sovler~\citep{rusanov1962calculation} is used to calculate the inviscid flux. For the viscous flux, the local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG)~\citep{cockburn1998local} method is used, with an upwind parameter of $\beta = 0.5$ and dissipation parameter of $\tau = 0.1$. For the time integration, a four-stage, third order strong stability preserving Runge-Kutta scheme~\citep{gottlieb2005} is adopted\Yongkai{make a double check}. For all simulations, a polynomial order of $p=4$ is used, corresponding to a 5th order of accuracy. The code is designed and tuned to the Sugon Z100 deep computing unit (DCU) to perform the large scale numerical simulations presented in this work. Parallelization of the code is achieved via the Message-Passing-Interface (MPI) on the CPU side. Several test cases including XXXXX are provided in the Appendix XXXX to justify the capability of the code to handle high-speed turbulent flow simulations.

\section{Notation and style}\label{notstyle}
 Generally any queries concerning notation and journal style can be answered by viewing recent pages in the Journal. However, the following guide provides the key points to note. It is expected that Journal style and mathematical notation will be followed, and authors should take care to define all variables or entities upon first use. Also note that footnotes are not normally accepted.  Abbreviations must be defined at first use, glossaries or lists/tables of abbreviations are not permitted.

\subsection{Mathematical notation}
\subsubsection{Setting variables, functions, vectors, matrices etc}
\begin{itemize} \label{sec:MathNot}
\item {\bf Italic font} should be used for denoting variables, with multiple-letter symbols avoided except in the case of dimensionless numbers such as $\Rey$, $\Pran$ and $\Pen$ (Reynolds, Prandtl, and P\'eclet numbers respectively, which are defined as \verb}\Rey}, \verb}\Pran} and \verb}\Pen} in the template).\\
\item {\bf Upright Roman font} (or upright Greek where appropriate) should be used for:\\
\begin {enumerate}
\item (vI) label, e.g.  T. t (transpose)\\
\item Fixed operators: sin, log, d, $\Delta$, exp etc.\\
\item Constants: i ($\sqrt{-1}$), $\upi$ (defined as \verb}\upi}),e  etc.\\
\item Special Functions: $\Ai$, $\Bi$ (Airy functions, defined as \verb}\Ai} and \verb}\Bi}), $\Real$ (real part, defined as \verb}\Real}), $\Imag$ (imaginary part, defined as \verb}\Imag}), etc.\\[-4pt]
\item Physical units: cm, s, etc.\\[-4pt]
\item Abbreviations: c.c. (complex conjugate), h.o.t. (higher-order terms), DNS, etc.\\[-4pt]
\end {enumerate}
\item {\bf Bold italic font} (or bold sloping Greek) should be used for vectors (with the centred dot for a scalar product also in bold): $\boldsymbol{i \cdot j}$\\[-4pt]
\item {\bf Bold sloping sans serif font}, defined by the \verb}\mathsfbi} macro, should be used for tensors and matrices: $\mathsfbi{D}$ \\[-4pt]
\item {\bf Calligraphic font} (for example $\mathcal{G}$, $\mathcal{R}$) can be used as an alternative to italic when the same letter denotes a different quantity use \verb}\mathcal} in \LaTeX)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Other symbols}  Large numbers  that are not scientific powers should not include commas, but should use a non-breaking space, and use the form 1600 or 16 000 or 160 000.
Use \textit{O} to denote `of the order of', not the \LaTeX\ $\mathcal{O}$.

The product symbol ($\times$) should only be used to denote multiplication where an equation is broken over more than one line, to denote a cross product, or between numbers . The $\boldsymbol {\cdot}$ symbol should not be used, except to denote a scalar product of vectors specifically.

\subsubsection{Example Equations}
 This section contains sample equations in the JFM style. Please refer to the {\LaTeX} source file for examples of how to display such equations in your manuscript.

\begin{equation}
  (\nabla^2+k^2)G_s=(\nabla^2+k^2)G_a=0
  \label{Helm}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \bnabla\bcdot\boldsymbol{v} = 0,\quad \nabla^{2}P=
    \bnabla\bcdot(\boldsymbol{v}\times \boldsymbol{w}).
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  G_s,G_a\sim 1 / (2\upi)\ln r
  \quad \mbox{as\ }\quad r\equiv|P-Q|\rightarrow 0,

  \quad \mbox{on\ }\quad y=0,\\[8pt]
\displaystyle  G_a=0
  \quad \mbox{on\ }\quad y=0,
 \end{array}\right\}
  \label{symbc}

\begin{equation}
  -\frac{1}{2\upi} \int_0^{\infty} \gamma^{-1}[\mathrm exp(-k\gamma|y-\eta|)
   + \mathrm exp(-k\gamma(2d-y-\eta))] \cos k(x-\xi)t\:\mathrm{d} t,
   \qquad 0<y,\quad \eta<d,
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \gamma(t) = \left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}
      -\mathrm{i}(1-t^2)^{1/2}, & t\le 1 \\[2pt]
      (t^2-1)^{1/2},         & t>1.
    \end{array} \right.
\end{equation}

\[
  -\frac{1}{2\upi}
   \pvi B(t)\frac{\cosh k\gamma(d-y)}{\gamma\sinh k\gamma d}
   \cos k(x-\xi)t\:\mathrm{d} t
\]

\begin{equation}
  G = -\frac{1}{4}\mathrm{i} (H_0(kr)+H_0(kr_1))
    - \frac{1}{\upi} \pvi\frac{\mathrm{e}^{-\kgd}}%
    {\gamma\sinh\kgd} \cosh k\gamma(d-y) \cosh k\gamma(d-\eta)
\end{equation}

Note that when equations are included in definitions, it may be suitable to render them in line, rather than in the equation environment: $\boldsymbol{n}_q=(-y^{\prime}(\theta),
x^{\prime}(\theta))/w(\theta)$.
Now $G_a=\squart Y_0(kr)+\Gat$ where
$r=\{[x(\theta)-x(\psi)]^2 + [y(\theta)-y(\psi)]^2\}^{1/2}$ and $\Gat$ is
regular as $kr\ttz$. However, any fractions displayed like this, other than $\thalf$ or $\squart$, must be written on the line, and not stacked (ie 1/3).

\begin{eqnarray}
  \ndq\left(\frac{1}{4} Y_0(kr)\right) & \sim &
    \frac{1}{4\upi w^3(\theta)}

    y^{\prime\prime}(\theta)x^{\prime}(\theta)] \nonumber\\
  & = & \frac{1}{4\upi w^3(\theta)}
    [\rho^{\prime}(\theta)\rho^{\prime\prime}(\theta)
    - \rho^2(\theta)-2\rho^{\prime 2}(\theta)]
    \quad \mbox{as\ }\quad kr\ttz . \label{inteqpt}
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{equation}
  \frac{1}{2}\phi_i = \frac{\upi}{M} \sumjm\phi_j K_{ij}^a w_j,
  \qquad i=1,\,\ldots,\,M,
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  K_{ij}^a = \left\{
    \begin{array}{ll}

      + [\rho_i^{\prime}\rho_i^{\prime\prime}-\rho_i^2-2\rho_i^{\prime 2}]

\begin{lemma}
Let $f(z)$ be a trial \citet[][pp.~231--232]{Batchelor59} function defined on $[0,1]$.  Let $\varLambda_1$ denote
the ground-state eigenvalue for $-\mathrm{d}^2g/\mathrm{d} z^2=\varLambda g$,
where $g$ must satisfy $\pm\mathrm{d} g/\mathrm{d} z+\alpha g=0$ at $z=0,1$
for some non-negative constant~$\alpha$.  Then for any $f$ that is not
identically zero we have
\begin{equation}
\frac{\displaystyle
  \alpha(f^2(0)+f^2(1)) + \int_0^1 \left(
  \frac{\mathrm{d} f}{\mathrm{d} z} \right)^2 \mathrm{d} z}%
  {\displaystyle \int_0^1 f^2\mathrm{d} z}
\ge \varLambda_1 \ge
\left( \frac{-\alpha+(\alpha^2+8\upi^2\alpha)^{1/2}}{4\upi} \right)^2.
\end{equation}
\end{lemma}

\begin{corollary}
Any non-zero trial function $f$ which satisfies the boundary condition
$f(0)=f(1)=0$ always satisfies
\begin{equation}
  \int_0^1 \left( \frac{\mathrm{d} f}{\mathrm{d} z} \right)^2 \mathrm{d} z.
\end{equation}
\end{corollary}

\subsection{Turbulent channel flow}
A compressible turbulent channel flow at $M_b = 1.5, Re_b = 5000$ is test in this subsection. The simulation is performed at $p = 4$, with a number of cells of $N_x \times N_y \times N_z = X \times X \times X$, leading to a total DoF of XXX. Mean flow statistics are compared with the DNS data by~\citet{2021_ChenScalo_JFM}, as shown in figure XX and XX. Both the mean streamwise velocity profile and the Reynolds stresses show good agreement with the reference data.
